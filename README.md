Kamusi
======

Cocoa Localization Framework for OS X, which uses Transifex ( http://www.transifex.com ) as its basis. Kamusi (Suaheli for 'dictionary') consists of few Cocoa classes doing all the work.

Kamusi Framework
-------
The Kamusi Cocoa framework is meant to be used by application developers to let their application be localized by its users. The framework checks whether there is a Transifex project registered for the current application and uses the cloud localizations directly for presentation in the user's preferred language.

As a result, Kamusi allows to localize the active application on the fly. This approach has the advantage that an application can be localized quickly by its user base.
